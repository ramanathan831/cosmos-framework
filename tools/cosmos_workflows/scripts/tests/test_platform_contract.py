"""Cross-platform contract tests for the SDK-free platform skills.

Every regression these guard against shipped in the 7.1.0 -> main merge and was
invisible to CI, because nothing cross-checked a skill's prose against the
scripts, templates, and metadata it describes:

  * a preflight referencing a path that does not exist (the k8s SETUP_SCRIPT
    dropped its ``skills/`` segment, so preflight always failed "file not found")
  * a platform silently losing job-record integration, so its jobs became
    untrackable while every sibling platform stayed consistent (Brev)
  * frontmatter advertising narrower capability than the body implements, so a
    router never selects the platform for the case it actually supports (k8s
    said "single-pod" while documenting Indexed-Job multi-node)

These are static: no GPU, no cluster, no credentials. They run on every MR.
Live execution smokes belong in the nightly platform pipeline instead.

    * The **filesystem** bit is authoritative for "would this actually run here",

      CI. This is the assertion that always runs.
    * The **git index** mode additionally catches a local `chmod +x` that was
      never committed — real, but only checkable where git works. CI containers
      often run as a different uid than the checkout owner, so git refuses with
      dubious-ownership, and a source export may have no `.git` at all. When git
      cannot answer we skip that half rather than failing: an earlier version
