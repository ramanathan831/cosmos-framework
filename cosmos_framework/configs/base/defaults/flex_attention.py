"""Whether the multiview generation attention runs on FlexAttention, and under what mask.

values too, and importing ``model_config`` from there is not possible: it pulls in the reasoner

can import.

# The noisy square is the largest quadrant of the multiview mask -- every other rule is already
# confined to a single ``(frame, view)`` cell -- so this is the choice that sets what the mask
# costs. For a sample of ``V`` views by ``F`` frames per view by ``S`` spatial tokens per cell,
# that quadrant holds ``(V*F*S)**2`` pairs, of which each scope keeps:
#
# * ``"all_views"``: all of them. Every camera sees every other one at every instant. This is
#   the default. Cost is (FVS)^2.
# * ``"same_view"``: ``1/V`` of them. Each camera only attends to its own noisy tokens. Cost
#   is V*(FS)^2.
# * ``"decomposed"``: Each camera attends to its own noisy tokens plus the same frame in
#   every other camera, which decomposes the square into a temporal half and a spatial one.
#   Cost is V*(FS)^2 + F*(VS)^2. Rejected on a joint camera + LiDAR pack unless
#   ``decomposed_temporal_window_seconds`` is set: the two streams do not share a frame
#   index, but they do share real capture time, which the window compares instead.
