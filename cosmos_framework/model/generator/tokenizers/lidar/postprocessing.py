"""Decode-side LiDAR postprocessing shared by the V0 and V1 tokenizers.

This module owns the validity cut: sigmoid of mask logits, then a probability
threshold. Tokenizers apply it in decode; tokenizer-training reconstructions
are still raw logits, so visualization asks this module for a keep-mask rather
than reimplementing the cut. Callbacks and renderers do not sigmoid or threshold.

A resolved clip -- dataloader ``{0, 1}``, or decode after the cut -- is read
with the same half-cut and is never sigmoided again. Range-map preparation on
the encode side belongs to ``preprocessing``.

This module also owns the range smoothing a generated clip is run through before
it is unprojected to XYZ, and the single switch that turns it on; see
:class:`RangeSmoothing` and ``DEFAULT_RANGE_SMOOTHING``.

    """Validity-aware bilateral filter for a metric range map, run before unprojection.

    A generated range map carries per-ray error that is invisible in the range
    view -- neighbouring rays differ by a few tenths of a metre either way -- but
    unprojection turns each ray into a point at its own distance, so that error
    becomes scatter along the ray direction and reads as a thick, noisy surface
    in bird's-eye view. Filtering the range before the unprojection is what
    removes it; nothing downstream of XYZ can tell scatter from structure.

    Each ray is replaced by a weighted mean of its window, where a neighbour's
    weight is a spatial Gaussian in pixels times a range Gaussian in metres. The
    range term is what keeps a depth discontinuity intact: rays across the gap
    fall many sigma away and contribute nothing, so a foreground edge is
    averaged along itself rather than smeared into the background behind it.
    Unlike a median, the estimate is continuous in the samples, so it removes
    sub-bin jitter instead of quantizing every ray onto whichever neighbour
    happens to sit in the middle.

    That window is one row wide by default, and the two axes are not
    interchangeable. Along a row the samples are one laser sweeping azimuth, so
    a smooth surface is nearly iso-range and the neighbours estimate it. Down a
    column each sample is a different beam at a different elevation, and on the
    ground plane -- most of a sweep -- that is a steep true range gradient, so
    those neighbours disagree because the surface really is at another distance.
    Averaging them in trades noise for distortion. Measured over 15 MADS sweeps,
    filtering ground truth with the 5x5 window this shipped with moves a
    surviving ray 0.098 m, against 0.067 m for one row; a 5x1 column-only
    control accounts for 0.079 m of that, which is where it comes from. On truth
    plus 0.2 m of per-ray jitter the row leaves 0.125 m against the square's
    0.133 m, and on 0.2 m of spatially correlated error -- the shape a decoder's
    error actually has -- the square leaves 0.165 m where not filtering at all
    leaves 0.160 m, while the row leaves 0.158 m. Set ``elevation_kernel_size``
    above 1 to average beams together again.

    The range bandwidth is ``range_sigma_m + range_sigma_ratio * range``,
    because a fixed bandwidth is the wrong shape for this data: two rays a
    degree apart that land on the same sloped ground are centimetres apart at
    10 m and metres apart at 80 m, so a bandwidth tight enough to clean the near
    field would treat the whole far field as unrelated surfaces.

    Weighting alone cannot remove a bad ray -- a flying pixel between a
    foreground edge and the background agrees with itself perfectly and would
    keep its own value. So a ray is dropped unless the weight its neighbours
    contribute, ``min_neighbor_support``, says a local surface corroborates it.
    That one rule covers both the flying pixel, whose neighbours are all too far
    in range to weigh anything, and isolated speckle, which has no valid
    neighbours to begin with. A row corroborates nearly as well as a square did:
    over the same sweeps with 1% of rays displaced, one row catches 97.6% of
    them against the square's 97.9%. The default asks for 19% of what a full
    window could contribute, which is the share the 5x5 default asked for, so
    the bar tracks the window rather than the shape.

    ``strength`` interpolates between the measured range (0.0) and the filtered
    estimate (1.0), so a run can keep some of the original relief.
