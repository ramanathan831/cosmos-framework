"""Tests for VAE load balancing: the pure-Python planner, the distributed offload itself,
and the real end-to-end model path on GPU.

``TestPlanRebalance`` exercises :func:`plan_rebalance` only -- no torch, no process group,
just the greedy-balancing arithmetic. ``TestOffloadEncode`` exercises
:func:`offload_encode`'s full two-phase point-to-point protocol against a real (CPU/gloo)
process group, using the same ``mp.spawn`` + file-init pattern as
``utils/model_loader_test.py``'s distributed tests -- no GPU required, gloo runs entirely
on CPU. Both are marked ``CPU`` and run in the normal (non-GPU) CI lane.

``test_balanced_vae_encode_on_a_real_4gpu_node`` is marked ``GPU`` and CANNOT run without
one: it needs a real 4-GPU node under ``torchrun`` (see ``_GPU_ONLY_REASON`` and the command
below), because it drives ``VisionEncoder.encode_items`` through the actual Wan2.2
VAE encode. There is deliberately no CPU/gloo fallback for it; anywhere else it skips.
