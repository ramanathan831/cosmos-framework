"""Source contract for the shared native action update and recovery path.

Family model/processor identities are deliberately separate: changing training code
must refuse exact resume without preventing inference from a portable artifact.
This explicit dependency inventory covers the single-device action SFT path, not
every trainer/backend in the repository. Runtime dependencies remain bound by the
family's pinned model identity; this contract binds the local Python implementation.
